[ ] Scalability
    [ ] Thread Safety
    [ ] Multihreaded simulation
    [ ] Multiple populations / worlds (migration, coevolution, etc)

[ ] Performance:
    [ ] Optimize evolve step malloc/free of program statements
	[ ] Investigate cache usage and branch prediction
	[ ] use one large initial malloc of num_registers * population_size,
   	    get rid of GP_MAX_REGISTERS

[ ] Refactor ops.h to use just structs instead of global vars

[ ] Add support for user run state/world data

[ ] The world init sequence is non-obvious and a bit verbose. Refactor.

[X] Standardize documentation and organize code (Docco?)

[ ] Test framework
    [ ] comparing different configurations / operation sets
	[ ] performance testing
	[ ] cgp examples
	[ ] benchmarking iterations to solve a problem

[ ] Doc: include custom docco.js with c language, and use github flavored markdown
