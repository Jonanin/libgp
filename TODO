[ ] Scalability
    [ ] Thread Safety
    [ ] Multihreaded simulation
    [ ] Multiple populations / worlds (migration, coevolution, etc)

[ ] Performance:
    [ ] Optimize evolve step malloc/free usage (program statements)
	[ ] Investigate cache usage and branch prediction characteristics
	[ ] use one large initial malloc of num_registers * population_size maybe?
   	[ ] get rid of GP_MAX_REGISTERS

[ ] Refactor ops.h to use just structs instead of global vars

[ ] Add support for user run state/world data

[ ] The world init sequence is non-obvious and a bit verbose - refactor.

[X] Standardize documentation and organize code (Docco?)
    [ ] include custom docco.js with c language, and use github flavored markdown

[ ] Test framework
    [ ] comparing different configurations / operation sets
	[ ] performance testing
	[ ] examples
	[ ] benchmarking iterations to solve a problem

[ ] Investigate machine code programs / JIT
