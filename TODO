[ ] Performance:
    [X] Optimize evolve step malloc/free usage (program statements)
	[?] Investigate cache usage and branch prediction characteristics
	[ ] Comperehensive Benchmarking

[ ] Approachability:
	[ ] More comprehensive code commenting
	[ ] A "tutorial" example that walks through basic usage
	[ ] Simplify world setup
	[ ] Utilities for easily running the common
	    "function that matches a dataset" problem

[ ] Test framework:
    [X] comparing different configurations / operation sets
	[ ] performance testing
	[X] examples

[ ] Misc:
	[X] Refactor ops.h to use just structs instead of global vars
	[ ] Add support for user run state/world data
	[X] The world init sequence is non-obvious and a bit verbose - refactor.
	[X] Standardize documentation and organize code (Docco?)

[ ] Scalability:
    [ ] Thread Safety
    [ ] Multihreaded simulation
    [ ] Multiple populations / worlds (migration, coevolution, etc)
