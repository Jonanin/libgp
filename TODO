[ ] Scalability
    [ ] Thread Safety
    [ ] Threaded simulation
    [ ] Multiple populations / isolated worlds

[ ] use one large initial malloc of num_registers * population_size,
    get rid of GP_MAX_REGISTERS

[ ] Refactor ops.h to use just structs instead of global vars

[ ] Add support for user run state data

[ ] Optimize evolve step malloc/free of program statements

[ ] Investigate cache usage and branch prediction performance

[ ] The world init sequence is non-obvious and a bit verbose. Refactor.
