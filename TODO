[ ] Scalability
    [ ] Thread Safety
    [ ] Multihreaded simulation
    [ ] Multiple populations / worlds (migration, etc)

[ ] Performance:
    [ ] Optimize evolve step malloc/free of program statements
	[ ] Investigate cache usage and branch prediction
	[ ] use one large initial malloc of num_registers * population_size,
   	    get rid of GP_MAX_REGISTERS

[ ] Investigate how to test different gp configurations / operation sets

[ ] Refactor ops.h to use just structs instead of global vars

[ ] Add support for user run state data

[ ] The world init sequence is non-obvious and a bit verbose. Refactor.

[X] Standardize documentation and organize code (Docco?)
