cgp is a simple but fast linear genetic programming library written in C.
cgp makes it easy to construct and test genetic programming problems efficiently.

(On a single core of my i7, it can do 1,000 evolution steps for a population of 20,000 in 5 seconds.
The goal from now on is to keep introducing features while maintaining that performance)
